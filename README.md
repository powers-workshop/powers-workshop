There is a long-standing view according to which potency precedes  actuality. Under this view, the happening of an event consists in the realization or manifestation of potentialities that already exist in the event’s participants. Indeed, the world seems full of entities that encapsulate such potentialities, which we usually refer to as realizable entities, with dispositions being among the most significant. 

A disposition is an entity that inheres in another entity and determines the behavior of the latter under certain circumstances. Dispositions are closely related to the causal powers that objects have in the world and encompass what we usually call abilities, capabilities, tendencies, propensities, liabilities, capacities, and so on. Typical examples of dispositions include the fragility of a piece of glass (i.e., the disposition to break in response to being struck), the hydrosolubility of salt (i.e., the disposition to dissolve in water when mixed with it), and the toxicity of a chemical substance (i.e., the disposition of damaging an organism when in contact with it).

As they link the static structure of the world (i.e., the endurants/continuants that populate it) to its dynamical structure (i.e., the perdurants/occurrents that can happen to or be performed by such continuants), realizable entities have become a popular topic in the Formal Ontology community, being subject of active research. Among other applications, realizable entities have been employed to represent diseases and biological functions, provide ontological grounds for risks and probabilities, model engineered artifacts and affordances, and describe organizational capabilities and social roles. 

Still, despite the prolific results, several open issues remain to be explored.

## Topics of Interest

Thus, the purpose of this workshop is to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners to present their work on dispositions and other realizable entities on issues including:

* Characterization and formalization of realizable entities (e.g., single vs. multi-track dispositions, degree of realization, formalisms for reasoning based on dispositions)

* Types of realizable entities (e.g., discussions on whether some core entities such as roles and biological/artifactual functions are realizable) and analysis of the contrast between dispositional and non-dispositional realizable entities

* Relation between realizable entities and entities from other categories (e.g., qualities, events)

* Domain applications (e.g., biology, health sciences, industry, enterprise modeling)

* Philosophical investigations relevant to formal ontology, including:

* Is the distinction between realizable and non-realizable (sometimes called “categorical”) properties metaphysical or linguistic? 

* Intrinsicness vs. extrinsicness of realizable entities

* How may the distinction between dispositions and powers be relevant for formal ontology?

* Can dispositions provide a good account of causation?

* How could blocks, finks, and antidotes be relevant for applied ontology?

* Can dispositions offer a good substitute for laws of nature in ontology?

## Audience

This interdisciplinary workshop is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in both applied and fundamental aspects of realizable entities. Information and computer scientists, philosophers, cognitive scientists, linguists, conceptual modelers, domain experts, and professionals from related disciplines are very welcome to participate.
